## Project rules
The project rules are according to the rules of the Modelica Association Bylaws. In particular: 
### Project members 
Project members are individual persons and organizations according to §3 of the MA Bylaws. Every 
individual and every organization has one vote. A person applying for project membership must have 
already actively contributed to this project. This requires usually to have attended at least two project 
meetings in the last 12 months. Membership is approved at a project meeting with a simple majority of the 
votes submitted (according to §14 of the MA Bylaws and with the quorum of §14). Membership 
resignation from this project applies immediately after written application to the project leader. The 
project leader is elected for two years at the MA Assembly meeting where the MA Board is elected and 
with the same rules as for a MA Board member. Project meetings are open to the public.

### Voting 
New releases of the Modelica Language specification shall be approved by the project members at a 
project meeting with a qualified majority of the number of votes submitted (according to §14 of the MA 
Bylaws and with the quorum of §14).

If the final Modelica Language release specification documents are not complete at the time of the 
meeting, the meeting may decide with a qualified majority to perform a confirmation vote electronically 
after the meeting when the final release documents are available, but not later than three months after the 
meeting.. Electronic voting is performed according to §14 of the Modelica Bylaws where the term “MA 
members” is replaced by the term “project members”.

## Initial project members
The initial project members are Modelica Association members that decide to join this project until may 7, 
2012. 

Initially, the contributors of Modelica language 3.1 and 3.2 are used as initial member and send by email 
to Modelica-design. If other MA members would like to be added or MA members removed from the 
initial member list, send an email to the MA Chairman (martin.otter at dlr.de)
